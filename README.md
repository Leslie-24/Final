#  Phishing Website Detection Using Machine Learning

A capstone project integrating **machine learning** and **Power BI** to automatically detect phishing websites based on their structural and behavioral attributes. This project demonstrates the power of data science in cybersecurity, emphasizing real-world applications such as threat detection, email filtering, and browser safety.

---


##  Project Overview

This project explores how machine learning can be used to **distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones** using features extracted from URLs. The solution includes a predictive model as well as an interactive Power BI dashboard for data exploration and communication of results.

---

##  Problem Statement

 **"Can machine learning effectively differentiate between phishing and legitimate websites?"**

Traditional methods such as blacklists or manual reporting are often **reactive and limited**. This project proposes a proactive approach by training a machine learning model to detect phishing attempts based on a variety of URL-based features.

## ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

Power BI was used to create an **interactive dashboard** showing:

- Class distribution of phishing vs legitimate URLs
- Feature importance
- Confusion matrix of model performance
- URL patterns with high correlation to phishing

##  Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions
- **Confusion Matrix:** Distribution of TP, TN, FP, FN
- **Precision:** How many predicted phishing sites were actually phishing
- **Recall:** How many actual phishing sites were detected
  ![dashboard](images/confusionmatrix.png)

>  The model performed well with **high recall and low false positive rate**, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

---

##  Key Insights

- **Abnormal URL structure** and **SSL certificate absence** were major indicators of phishing.
- Use of **IP addresses** instead of domain names increased phishing likelihood.
- **Legitimate websites** often have more consistent, secure patterns (SSL enabled, no pop-ups, etc.).

---

##  Recommendations

- Integrate model with:
  - **Email spam filters**
  - **Browser plugins**
- Educate users on common phishing traits (e.g., suspicious characters, no SSL)
- Continuously update the dataset with **recent phishing threats**
- Combine with **real-time reputation APIs** for increased accuracy

---

##  Future Work

- Expand dataset to thousands of URLs from global sources
- Apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to webpage text content
- Explore **ensemble models** like Random Forest and XGBoost
- Build a **real-time Power BI dashboard** with live threat monitoring
